## Quick Start / How to use this e-book
1. **Pick a layout** — choose single-column for ATS compatibility or two-column for a modern, scannable design.

3. **Write a short summary** — 3–5 sentences tailored to the job; include key skills and measurable impact.  
4. **List professional experience** — reverse chronological, use action verbs, and quantify achievements.  
5. **Add education & projects** — include technologies used and links where possible.  
6. **Specify skills** — prioritize relevant technical skills; include a short list of soft skills.  
7. **Use optional sections** only if they add value (certificates, awards, languages, relevant hobbies).  
8. **Seek feedback** — iterate with mentors, peers, or online communities.

## Best Practices (at a glance)
- Keep it concise — 1 page for early-career, up to 2 pages for extensive experience.  
- Prioritize relevance — tailor each resume to the job description.  
- Use numbers — quantify achievements (e.g., "improved performance by 30%").  
- Avoid personal info — no date of birth, marital status, or national ID.  
- Proofread — correct spelling, punctuation, and link targets.
